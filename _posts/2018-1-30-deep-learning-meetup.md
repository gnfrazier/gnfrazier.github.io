title: Deep Learning RTP Meetup - Getting Started With Deep Learning
tags: ai deep-learning fast-ai

Below are my notes from last night's meet up with [Deep Learning RTP](https://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-RTP "Meetup.com - Deep Learning RTP"). The presentation was an overview of [Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders MOOC](http://course.fast.ai/ "Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Part 1"). I remember the organizer pitching the course last year at a Pydata meetup. The group seemed to learn a lot in a good way in a short amount of time. 

The course notes that you will probably spend 10 hours a week for 7 weeks which includes a total of 20 hours of video. I am concerned that I don't have time to keep up with the group, but if I focus other goals (write, Python daily, learn something every week) around the course it might work out in the long run. 

Last night's presenter, Danny Siegel, had a good outlook "Try it and see if you like it." Which is what I think I will do.
