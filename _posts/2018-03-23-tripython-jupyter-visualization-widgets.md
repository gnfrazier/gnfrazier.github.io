[Mattew Mccormick from Kitware](https://blog.kitware.com/author/matt-mccormick/) presented  ITK - Insight Tool Kit in Jupyter Notebooks at the March Tripython meetup. During his talk he featured a handful of Jupyter tools for working with 2D and 3D visualizations. 

**Interactive 3D and 2D Visualizations**   

[ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) - will fetch interactive maps, you can zoom in, draw polygons etc.  Lots of [map providers listed with previewer](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/). (Update: see my post [Review: iPyleaflet Jupyter Widge](/intro-to-ipyleaflet/))

[geonotebook](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geonotebook) - developed by Kitware. Client server environment 

[ipyvolume](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume) - 3D plotting for python in Jupyter based on WebGL, mostly for plotting 3d data and machine learning. 

[pythreejs](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs) - base to ipyvolume, core library for other 3d projects.

[itk-jupyter-widgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-jupyter-widgets) - spacial analysis with the Insight Toolkit (ITK).  

[Planetlabs Notebooks](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks) - Satellite image analysis demo notebooks. Planet Data has an API to search, activate, and download satellite imagery.
