Last year I went to a talk during the  Triagle conference about Business Analysis. I have been in an Agile environment for a number of years, but we didn't use [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method "Wikipedia - MoSCoW Method") to rank features. Intriguing but I didn't think about it much until my annual Evernote review.

Traditionally MoSCoW stands for:
**M**ust  
**S**hould  
**Co**uld  
**W**on't  

There are a bunch of variations for the last **W** won't, wish, etc. Frequently I see an **X** to stand for exclude, since some features do not ever deserve to live. On my next project I am going to use a modified version that overcomes some criticism of the original MoSCoW.

**M**ust  
**S**hould  
**C**uld 
**O**ptimize 
**W**ish
**X**clude

In an iterative process this emphasizes optimization of the product before wish features start to get tacked on. I'll leave the definition of optimization broad. It could be code optimization, speed improvements, UX improvements, workflow improvements...
