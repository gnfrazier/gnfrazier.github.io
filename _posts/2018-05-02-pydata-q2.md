News agencies noted that the US government was only capturing about half of actual arrest related deaths. Starting in 2011 there was a push to record the data more accurately.

[RTI](https://www.rti.org/) (David's employer) worked with Burea of Justice Statistics to redo their data collection.

They scrape data from news sorces to gather the raw data.
