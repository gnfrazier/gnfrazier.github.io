title: Triagile 2018 - Conference Notes 
tags: conference agile project-management learning
---

Yesterday I had a full day with an early meeting with a provider, then the drive to Raleigh for Triagile 2018.

This was my 3rd year attending and I was impressed with how attendance has grown. This year all the talks were more focused on Agile, being an Agilist, the Agile Journey and so on. Last year there was a lot of variety and I am assuming that the organizers were responding to feedback. 

Due to my meeting I missed the intro and the first 5 minutes of the Keynote. 

#### Keynote: Gil Broza

Being a bit late I was standing for the keynote and didn't take many notes. Gil set the tone for the day staying on topic with how an organization approaches Agile in the middle levels of the structure is what determines the outcome. My biggest take away is that becoming truly Agile with a big 'A' is more than just doing all the steps - it requires changing how the organization thinks in regards to nearly everything.

#### Ron Statt - The Intersection Of Agile And User Interface Design Examples And Practices For Success

This topic is front of mind for me right now. It is something we are struggling with. Fortunately we are about to hire a Front End Developer and the conversations may get easier. Ron's talk explored a 6 month time line of his team at SAS working closely with designers through the creation of a greenfield software project. 

My take away was to empower and encourage designers to keep initial working models and prototypes low-fidelity. This theme re-appeared during my 3rd session. I had forgotten about Design Thinking as a process and I want to dig in to it more. 

From the last bits of my notes:

> What to do tomorrow  
>     - Include the \\&lt;designer> in your team tomorrow  
>     - Adjust the iteration expectations ahead of time  
>     - Use a parralelle high level track for greenfield/revolutionary design  
>     - Use Design Thinking Research Spikes  
>     - Demo with the end in mind
