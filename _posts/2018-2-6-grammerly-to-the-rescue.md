A while ago, 2015 maybe, I used Grammarly, it was interesting but not much better than my standard spell checker. I used it for a while, then it was a pain and slow, then I removed it. 

After digging around for a better spell checker/grammar checker for Atom. I found something. Grammarly.

I went through every blog post. Pasted it into Grammarly and applied the corrections. I could tell where I activated the linter, and where I was running late and had to dig in to something.

So now I am using Grammarly again. Despite the security risks. If only some clever Atom Editor plugin author would do one for Grammarly Markdown. That would be wicked.
