A while ago, 2015 maybe, I used Grammarly, it was interesting but not much better than my standard spell checker. I used it for a while, in time I found it was a pain and slow, so I removed it. 

After digging around for a better spell checker/grammar checker for Atom. I found something. Grammarly. While I don't see a plugin or package for navtive support as of this writing, I can use the Markdown preview window, copy the content to clipboard then paste in a Grammarly window. A little manual but it works, and I have found I can stay focused on the next sentence rather than worrying about the previous one. 

I went through every blog post. Pasted it into Grammarly and applied the corrections. In general I have not had many corrections per  post. I could tell where I activated the linter, and where I was running late and had to dig in to something. A few commas here, a different verb form there. 

So now I am using Grammarly again. [Despite the security risks](https://www.cyberscoop.com/bug-in-grammarly-browser-extension-exposes-virtually-everything-a-user-ever-writes/). If only some clever Atom Editor plugin author would do one for Grammarly Markdown. That would be wicked.
