The title says it all. I have been trying out i3 windows manager on both Windows 10 and on Linux. Overall I like it, and I am using it right now to write this blog post.

### How I got interested

 @jessfraz  tweeted about running i3 on WSL. Later in the thread:

### What is i3?

In short, it brings mac like window tiling powers to your linux (an now through WSL Windows) machine. All manipulated by hotkeys, switch from window to window, workspace to workspace. Resize, move and change windows, open/close mostly anything you can think of to keep your hands on the keyboard and off the mouse. 

### Learning i3

After watching this video I was hooked.

I followed the path explained in [Brian Ketelsen's blog post](https://brianketelsen.com/blog/i3-windows/ "brianketelsen.com - Running i3 Window Manager on Bash For Windows") and configured i3 on my work laptop under WSL. After resolving a hotkey conflict, I really like how it works. It is like a superpower. 

A few days later I installed and configured the laptop I use for most non-work projects, an older Thinkpad X1 with [Solus-Linux ](https://solus-project.com/), I have been using Budgie since I installed Solus, running i3 is quite a change. Luckily the [second video in the Code Cast i3wm series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-S0cWnLBKg) walks through many of the steps to make i3 feel more polished.
