The title says it all. I have been trying out i3 windows manager on both Windows 10 and on Linux. Overall I like it, and I am using it right now to write this blog post.

### Getting Started

Rather than giving step by step instructions, I'll show the journey I followed at a high level. It all started with a tweet  by @jessfraz  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok so I think what I want to do for my windows computer is i3 running in WSL, full screen boot to that, ignore rest of Windows...</p>&mdash; jessie frazelle (@jessfraz) <a href="https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/906266117253066753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
