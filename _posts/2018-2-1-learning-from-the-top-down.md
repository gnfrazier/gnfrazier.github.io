title: Learning from the Top Down

Like many people, when exploring a new topic I get 'Ah Ha!' moments. I had one last night while watching the first lesson video of the fast.ai deep learning course. At [about 30 minutes in](https://youtu.be/IPBSB1HLNLo?t=31m3s "YouTube - Fast.ai Lesson 1: Deep Learning 2018 31:03") Jeremy mentions learning from top down vs bottom up. 

> 'Ah Ha! This is why I struggle learning in a traditional classroom.'

In the video Rachel chimes in that their method is based on [David Perkins - The Whole Game](https://www.thepositiveencourager.global/david-perkins-making-learning-whole/ "Positive Encourager - Making Learning Whole") and his book _[Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719 "Amazon.com - Making Learning Whole by David Perkins")_. When I have really learned a topic, I know the end goal before I start. As I noted in my post on [Learning Markdown](/learning-markdown/) I was exposed to the end product of Markdown several times before I got enough motivation and momentum to dig in and learn it. Recently I took a statistics class, I did very well because I knew where I wanted to apply what I was learning. Knowing that at the end I could put those concepts to use right away motivated me to study and really learn. 

With the Fast.ai course I am a little shady on the end goal and how I will apply it. Guess I need to figure that out now.
