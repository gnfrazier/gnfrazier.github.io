Took some notes at the Pydata meetup tonight.

How Design Skills are necessary in Data Science

Good Implementation Requires Good Design

-   Know it when I see it vs here are the rules you must follow them

Having vision in your design

-   Know your tools
-   Knowing how it all goes together    

Many of the technical aspects are being automated

-   Most fundamental tools are now part of an api
    Design is taking the end goal    

-   organizing        
-   breaking down    
-   difficulty is in the conceptual experience

Skills

-   Domain Expertise is the hardest part to learning
-   Communication is required
-   Design is a spectrum

Anthropologist gather stories and interpret them in a way that is understandable to the reader.

-   Iterative process
-   Work through the variations
-   Each round the difference is smaller and smaller
-   Each step is a difference in how the designer sees the world vs how others see the World

The only way data has a voice is if the tool is built to enable that.

-   Tooling for design is an unexplored field.
-   Developing data analysis soft skills will require tools that leverage those skills.
-   

A focus on design is the best chance that data science has to survive scrutiny from a skeptical public.

## Lightning Talks
