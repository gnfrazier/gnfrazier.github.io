It started with a [blog post by Ian Lurie](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm "Why I Use Markdown, & You Should Too") in September 2016. At the time I had a workflow of feedly -> pocket -> evernote. That post made it to evernote with a tag to revisit.

Suddenly references to Markdown were everywhere. [Conferences](https://pydata.org/carolinas2016/ "Pydata Carolinas"), [podcasts](https://www.podcastinit.com/episode-20-static-site-generators-with-justin-mayer-and-roberto-alsina/ "Podcast.\_\_init\_\_ - Static Site Generators..."), and of course readme.md on github. After a few frustrating mis-steps with using nano to edit Markdown, I resigned to editing readme files in the browser instead of locally.

My second false start with Markdown was in June 2017. I got really excited about [using Jupyter instead of powerpoint](https://medium.com/@mjspeck/presenting-code-using-jupyter-notebook-slides-a8a3c3b59d67 "Medium.com - Presenting Code Using Jupyter"). Neatly formatted and _runable_ code in my slides? Sign me up! A few trials and odd line breaks had me back to boring old powerpoint. Then a [lightning talk at All Things Open 2017](https://youtu.be/6Spfq_fcTTE "YouTube - Reveal.JS presentation hacksâ€”Ryan Jarvinen") renewed my interest. Quickly followed by another timely blog post by Ian Lurie. His post on [how to set up Atom for Markdown](https://www.portent.com/blog/content-strategy/atom-markdown.htm "Portent Int - How to Set Up & Use Atom as a Markdown Editor") was the tipping point. 

During my annual clean out of evernote, I came across that initial that started this whole thing, I was just too busy to think about Markdown. 

Here it is January, I am not taking a class this semester, holidays are over, and the weather is shockingly cold. Finally time to take the plunge into Markdown. I set up a github pages blog using [Jekyll](/2018-1-16-why-jekyll.md "Why Jekyll?") to give me a real reason to use Markdown. This is my second post written in Atom. Having an environment that I know and trust has been the friction reducer I needed.

#### Update 1/20/2018

I added [linter-markdown](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-markdown "GitHub - linter-markdown") to Atom to avoid making some silly errors. 

#### Additional Reading:

[Kramdown Quick Reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html "Kramdown.com - Quick Ref") is a nice cheat sheet to less used markup and notations. Kramdown has some additional features that are not in GFM. 

[List of languages for Syntax Highlighting in Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers "GitHub - List of Supported Languages and Lexers")

[Markdownify](https://markdownify.js.org/ "Markdownify.org") for a lightweight alternative to Atom. Atom is more code editor than a word processor. Markdownify is the middle ground between Atom and focuswriter. 

[Markdown Please!](http://markdownplease.com/ "Markdownplease.com") a [Kenneth Reitz](https://www.kennethreitz.org/) project. Convert an HTML webpage to Markdown. Handy if importing an old blog or website to a Markdown-based CMS.
