title: A victim of  Timor Crispus Adstringit

While not professionally diagnosed, I am sure I have a case of _Timor Crispus Adstringit_. My case may be mild, but I have deep empathy for any that may suffer a more acute or persistent affliction. Until yesterday I thought I had overcome _Timor Crispus Adstringit_ since I can do this with no ill effects:

```python
d = {'key1':[value1, value2],
        'key2':[value1, value2]}
```

Yesterday a co-worker something similar to this to me for help in debugging a site issue:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("load", function () {
  iframe.style.display = "none";
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
});
```

It triggered what I can only explain as a 'Flight or Fight' response. Elevated heart rate, sweating, nervousness. While there were more than  2 { } in the snippet he sent, it was just a little JavaScript. 

I am sure _Timor Crispus Adstringit_ is not uncommon. Frequently "what's with all these curly braces?" is expressed on various podcasts I listen to. I feel the need to at least have a good understanding of JavaScript. How can I overcome this annoying condition?
